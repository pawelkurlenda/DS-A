| Data Structure             | Description                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Array](Array.md)                      | A fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Elements are accessed by index. |
| [List<T>](List_T.md)                    | A dynamic array that grows as needed. It is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace.  |
| [LinkedList<T>](LinkedList_T.md)              | A doubly linked list, where each node points to both its next and previous node.                 |
| [Stack<T>](Stack_T.md)                   | A collection of objects that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.                    |
| [Queue<T>](Queue_T.md)                   | A collection of objects that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.                   |
| [Dictionary<TKey, TValue>](Dictionary_TKey_TValue.md)   | A collection of key/value pairs. Provides fast lookup by keys.                                   |
| [HashSet<T>](HashSet_T.md)                 | A collection that contains no duplicate elements and has fast lookup and insertion.              |
| [SortedList<TKey, TValue>](SortedList_TKey_TValue.md)   | A collection of key/value pairs that are sorted by the keys and can be accessed by key or index. |
| [SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>](SortedDictionary_TKey_TValue.md) | A dictionary that maintains the keys in sorted order.                                        |
| [SortedSet<T>](SortedSet_T.md)               | A collection of unique elements that are sorted.                                                 |
| [Queue](Queue.md)                      | A non-generic collection of objects that follows the FIFO principle.                             |
| [Stack](Stack.md)                      | A non-generic collection of objects that follows the LIFO principle.                             |
